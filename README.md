This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

We are building Splittle (decentralized splitwise app) . Now you can split your crypto bills in a very easy way. We are targeting the "best use of Polygon ID", and "best public goods" in the prize categories. 

Decentralized splitwise is simple and solves many problems:- 
- Splittle is decentralized, not any single point of failure. No single party controlling all the data.
- All the transactions are stored on chain, hence immutable, transparent, secure.
- Now all the users are authentic, because users are represented as wallets. Now, no one can settle money without paying it. In every expense added, now both parties consents are taken.
